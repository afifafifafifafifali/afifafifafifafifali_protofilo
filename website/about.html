  <h1>Hello, I'm Afif. And I'm a highly skilled Script kiddie</h1>

  <h2>Thanks for stopping by and taking a moment to explore my journey and expertise.</h2>


  <p>
    
    I was born in 24 july,2013.Since i was in grade 1 , I was always curious about computer and how do video games work.In my 2nd grade , I got my first computer with an i3 proccessor. 
    I started coding with scratch & codeorg . But, At the end, I didn't like that much because they weren't machine runnable. Then , I started  learning my first scripted-language , and that was HTML.
    I pause coding for at December,2021.In January(2022),I started Coding by seeing youtube . I leaned much about pc , and earned a codeorg computer science certificate . That's why , I didn't have to do the A+ exam.
    &emsp; &emsp; I didn't take the exams for some appropiate reasons e.g. 1usd = 110.5 bdt . I'm also a very nerdy student.And I'm a student of St. Gregory's High School & College.The most discipline school in Bangladesh.I'm currently studying ingrad 5(2024)
  </p>

  <h3> What am I working on?</h3>
    <p> I'm currently working on three things:
        1.Orzen-dos developed in c
        2.Antivirus
        3.Certification providing company & exam taking protocol (owaspo)
    </p>
